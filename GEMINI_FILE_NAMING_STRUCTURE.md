# File Naming Structure for Crossword Project

All files related to the crossword puzzle functionality must be prefixed with "crossword_".

For example:
- `crossword_generator.js`
- `crossword_wordbank.js`
- `crossword_test.html`

The only exception to this rule is `index_crossword.html`, which serves as the main entry point for the crossword section.
