# How to Work with Gemini

To get the most efficient help, use direct, action-oriented phrases. This tells me to generate the code for the action immediately for your review, instead of just talking about it.

## Best Phrases to Use:

*   "Show me the code for review."
*   "Generate the changes."
*   "Execute the plan."
*   "Make the changes."
*   "Do it."

## What Gemini Will Do:

When you use these phrases, I will immediately generate the necessary tool code (like `write_file` or `run_terminal_command`) in a code block for you to review and approve.
